      <h2>HTTP Today</h2>
      <p>Modern web traffic uses HTTPS which is HTTP combined with TLS encryption, this is for confidentiality and integrity. Browsers
      enforce the use of HTTPS for websites as it is seen as safe and reliable. If a website does not use a HTTPS the browser will label the website as 
      "Not Secure" or "Unsafe" as a warning to the user. Major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud depend on HTTP, due to HTTP's ability to 
      deliver web applications on a scale. Today, HTTP has grown to be the backbone for online communication.</p>

      <h2>Where HTTP Is Going</h2>
      <p>
        The future of HTTP is closely linked to the adoption of HTTP/3, which runs over QUIC/UDP for faster, and reliable
        connections, especially on mobile. Growing areas like the Internet of Things (IoT), will soon adapt HTTP/3 as many devices are implementing web connections.
        These devices do not just include the average smart phone or computer, but also smart home devices, appliaces, and vehicles. As more devices become
        connected to the internet privacy and security will become more of an importance as added security will prevent data breaches and make users feel more comfortable and
        safe when using these devices. This is especially important when dealing with AI because it is growing in the tech world and it is being used more often. More AI
        tools are being implemented by companies and websites, and HTTP wuthh need to be able to handle large amounts of data and traffic. HTTP will continue evlolve 
        and meet new challenges and demands of the modern web.
